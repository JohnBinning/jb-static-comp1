## Synopsis

This is a site dedicated to a true American hero.  He doesn't tolerate communism, skim milk, or non-responsive CSS.

Project parameters were to mimic the outline of http://frontend.turing.io/assets/images/static-comp-challenge-1.jpg
and make it responsive.  My final product (desktop version) can be seen here http://imgur.com/a/0LaVL 

## Motivation

I wanted to create a site that honored Ron and his dedication to the American way.
I also needed to practice my CSS, and I didn't want to be publicly shamed by Louisa.
